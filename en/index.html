      <h1>Cartio Privacy and Security Policy</h1>

    <div class="container">
      <small>Last updated: 18/02/2025</small>

      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Thank you for using Cartio! This Privacy and Security Policy explains
        how we handle your information when you use our app. Cartio is designed
        to help you create quick and easy shopping cart lists, and we are
        committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your
        data. By using Cartio, you agree to the practices described in this
        policy. If you do not agree with this policy, please do not use the app.
      </p>

      <h3>1.1 Anonymous Authentication</h3>
      <p>Cartio uses Firebase Authentication to allow you to use the app anonymously. This means no personally identifiable information (e.g., name, email, phone number) is collected during authentication.</p>
      
      <h3>1.2 User Feedback</h3>
      <p>You can submit feedback, suggestions, or problem reports through the app. These submissions are completely anonymous and stored in Firestore (a Firebase database). No personally identifiable information is collected or stored with your feedback.</p>
      
      <h3>1.3 Shopping Lists</h3>
      <p>Your shopping lists are stored locally on your device using localStorage. These lists are not sent to our servers or shared with third parties.</p>
      
      <h3>1.4 Advertisements</h3>
      <p>Cartio displays ads through Google AdMob. AdMob may collect data to serve personalized ads, including your device’s advertising identifier and usage data. For more information, please review <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google’s Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
      
      <h3>1.5 Premium Subscriptions</h3>
      <p>If you choose to purchase a premium subscription, your payment and subscription data are handled by RevenueCat. RevenueCat does not store payment information (e.g., credit card details), as this is managed by the app stores (Google Play or Apple App Store). For more information, please review <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy" target="_blank">RevenueCat’s Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
      
      <h2>2. Data Storage and Security</h2>
      <h3>2.1 Local Storage</h3>
      <p>Your shopping lists are stored locally on your device using localStorage. Cartio requests access to your device’s storage to save and retrieve this data. This data is not transmitted to our servers or shared with third parties.</p>
      
      <h3>2.2 Firestore</h3>
      <p>User feedback, suggestions, and problem reports are stored in Firestore, a cloud database provided by Firebase. This data is anonymous and cannot be linked to your identity.</p>
      
      <h3>2.3 Data Security</h3>
      <p>We take reasonable measures to protect your data. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your information, we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>
      
      <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>Cartio uses the following third-party services, each of which has its own privacy policies:</p>
      <ul>
          <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">Firebase Authentication and Firestore</a>: For anonymous authentication and storing user feedback.</li>
          <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google AdMob</a>: For displaying ads.</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy" target="_blank">RevenueCat</a>: For managing premium subscriptions.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>4. Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>Cartio is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided us with information, please contact us, and we will take steps to delete such information.</p>
      
      <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
      <h3>5.1 Access and Control</h3>
      <p>Since Cartio does not collect personally identifiable information, there is no account or profile data to access or modify.</p>
      <p>Your shopping lists are stored locally on your device and can be deleted at any time by clearing the app’s data or uninstalling the app.</p>
      
      <h3>5.2 Feedback Deletion</h3>
      <p>If you would like to delete any feedback, suggestions, or problem reports you submitted, please contact us at <strong>alessandromacanhadev@gmail.com</strong>. We will remove your data from Firestore upon request.</p>
      
      <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this Privacy and Security Policy from time to time. If we make significant changes, we will notify you through the app or via email (if applicable). Your continued use of Cartio after any changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
